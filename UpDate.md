Your comments and suggestions were really very importants for us to arrive at the final version of our application that answers wisely to the requirements of the specifications and it will help students learn to play on the instruments they want.

1/- When selecting multiple songs, add a color to the most used chords:
 In order to improve the quality of our visualization we used a high density color as well as increased the splicer curves that represent the sequence of chords.
