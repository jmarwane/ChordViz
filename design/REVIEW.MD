Visualization of annual energy consumption data _ data source: ENEDIS

## Visualization methods :
The data used are data on the consumption of electricity in France, according to the regions and sectors of activity.

There are 3 ways of viewing:
- A sankey diagram that allows the representation of flows.
- A radar chart that displays the average energy consumption by each unit: for example in the industry sector, it is used to calculate the average of all the sites and to see the total, it is necessary to multiply by the number of sites, the residential...
- a geo map used to visualize the annual consumption.
## Comments and points of improvement :
 <ls> 
 1 . Please try to visualize the data according to years, months and weeks.
 </br>
 2 . You have work with a database that contains only the data concerning the consumption of electric energy for the year 2006.
  </br>
 3 . In order to use a large database, you can add enough filters to get a good visualization.
  </br>
 4 . As a point of improvement, you can add a graph that visualizes the evolution of the consumption of electric energy according to the years by integrating the seasonal factors.
